## Documentation First Rules

### Rule C-001: Read Documentation Before Acting 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Before making ANY changes or writing ANY code, the AI agent MUST read and understand the project documentation.

**Required Reading Order**:

1. `README.md` - Project overview and setup
2. `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
3. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - AI-specific instructions
4. `templates/rules.md` - Development rules
5. `templates/agents.md` - Agent configuration
6. `templates/ai-linting-rules.md` - Code quality rules
7. Any domain-specific documentation in `docs/` or `templates/`

**Rationale**: Loading documentation into context ensures the AI agent understands:

- Project architecture and patterns
- Coding conventions and standards
- Existing utilities and functions
- Testing requirements
- Security considerations

### Rule C-002: Search for Existing Documentation 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Before implementing ANY feature, search for existing documentation that might inform your approach.

**Search Locations**:

```
./README.md
./docs/
./templates/
./.github/
./CHANGELOG.md
./API.md
./ARCHITECTURE.md
./RUNBOOK.md
```

**Actions**:

1. Search for keywords related to your task
2. Read any relevant documentation found
3. Note any constraints or requirements discovered
4. Reference documentation in your implementation

### Rule C-003: Check for Similar Implementations 🟠 REQUIRED

**Description**: Before writing new code, search the codebase for similar implementations.

**Search Strategy**:

```bash
# Search for similar function names
grep -r "functionName" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Search for similar patterns
grep -r "pattern" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Search for similar imports
grep -r "import.*ModuleName" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```

---

## Non-Destructive Action Rules

### Rule C-010: Never Delete Without Permission 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: AI agents must NEVER delete files, directories, data, or significant code without explicit user permission.

**Prohibited Actions** (without permission):

```
❌ rm -rf / rm -r / rmdir commands
❌ DELETE queries on databases
❌ Removing functions/classes/modules
❌ Clearing caches/storage
❌ Dropping tables/collections
❌ Overwriting configuration files completely
❌ Force pushing to branches
❌ Hard resetting git history
```

**Required Before Destructive Actions**:

1. Explain what will be deleted
2. Explain why deletion is necessary
3. Propose alternatives if possible
4. Ask for explicit confirmation
5. Create backup if applicable

### Rule C-011: Preserve Working Code 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Never remove or significantly modify working code unless absolutely necessary and user-approved.

**Guidelines**:

```
✅ Add new code alongside existing code
✅ Deprecate before removing
✅ Comment out instead of delete (temporarily)
✅ Create backup branches
✅ Use feature flags for new implementations
```

### Rule C-012: No Cutting Corners 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: AI agents must not take shortcuts that compromise code quality, security, or functionality.

**Prohibited Shortcuts**:

```
❌ Disabling security checks
❌ Skipping input validation
❌ Removing error handling
❌ Hardcoding values that should be configurable
❌ Ignoring edge cases
❌ Using unsafe defaults
❌ Skipping tests to "save time"
❌ Using deprecated APIs without migration plan
```

### Rule C-013: Reversible Changes First 🟠 REQUIRED

**Description**: When possible, make changes that are easily reversible.

**Strategies**:

```
✅ Use version control effectively
✅ Create feature branches
✅ Implement with feature flags
✅ Add new code before removing old code
✅ Document rollback procedures
```

---

## Use Existing Tools Rules

### Rule C-020: Discover Before Creating 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Before creating ANY new function, utility, or tool, search extensively for existing implementations.

**Search Strategy**:

```bash
# 1. Search project codebase
grep -r "functionName" --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" .

# 2. Check utility files
ls src/utils/ src/helpers/ src/lib/ src/common/

# 3. Check package.json for existing dependencies
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies, .devDependencies'

# 4. Search for similar patterns
grep -r "similar pattern" .
```

### Rule C-021: Use Project Utilities 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Always use existing project utilities instead of creating duplicates.

**Common Utility Locations**:

```
src/utils/
src/helpers/
src/lib/
src/common/
src/shared/
src/core/
```

**Before Creating New Utility**:

1. List all files in utility directories
2. Read relevant utility files
3. Check if existing utility can be extended
4. If creating new, follow existing patterns

### Rule C-022: Leverage Existing Dependencies 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Use libraries already in the project before adding new ones.

**Checklist**:

1. Review `package.json` (npm), `requirements.txt` (pip), `Cargo.toml` (Rust), etc.
2. Check if existing dependency provides needed functionality
3. Read existing dependency documentation
4. Only add new dependency if absolutely necessary

**Example**:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - adding lodash when native array methods exist
import _ from 'lodash';
const filtered = _.filter(arr, fn);

// ✅ Good - using native JavaScript
const filtered = arr.filter(fn);
```

### Rule C-023: Don't Reinvent the Wheel 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Never reimplement functionality that already exists in the project or standard libraries.

**Common Reinventions to Avoid**:

| Need | Don't Reinvent | Use Instead |
| ------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| UUID generation | Custom function | `crypto.randomUUID()` or existing lib |
| Date formatting | Custom parser | Existing date lib in project |
| Validation | Custom validators | Project's validation utils |
| HTTP requests | Custom fetch wrapper | Existing HTTP client |
| Logging | Custom logger | Project's logger |
| Configuration | Custom config reader | Existing config system |

### Rule C-024: Extend, Don't Duplicate 🟠 REQUIRED

**Description**: When existing code is close but not exact, extend it rather than duplicate.

**Strategies**:

```javascript
// ❌ Bad - duplicating entire function
function formatDateUS(date) {
  // Duplicated logic from formatDate
}

// ✅ Good - extending existing function
function formatDate(date, locale = 'default') {
  // Original logic with locale support
}
const formatDateUS = (date) => formatDate(date, 'en-US');
```

```

**How to Ask**:

```markdown
I need clarification before proceeding:

1. **Question**: [Specific question]
   **Context**: [Why this matters]
   **Options**: [If applicable]

2. **Question**: [Another question]
   ...
```

### Rule C-031: Clarify Ambiguous Requirements 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Never assume meaning when requirements are ambiguous.

**Ambiguity Examples**:

```
Ambiguous: "Make it faster"
Ask: "What is the current performance? What is the target?
      Which operations should be optimized?"

Ambiguous: "Add user authentication"
Ask: "What auth methods? OAuth? JWT? Sessions?
      Which providers? What roles/permissions?"

Ambiguous: "Fix the bug"
Ask: "Which bug specifically? Can you provide steps to reproduce?
      What is expected vs actual behavior?"
```

### Rule C-032: Confirm Before Major Changes 🔴 CRITICAL

**Description**: Always confirm with user before making significant architectural or design changes.

**Major Changes Include**:

- Database schema changes
- API contract changes
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Core algorithm changes
- Dependency additions/removals
- Infrastructure changes
- Breaking interface changes

### Rule C-033: Document Assumptions 🟠 REQUIRED

**Description**: When making assumptions (after reasonable effort to clarify), document them clearly.

**Format**:

```javascript
/**
 * ASSUMPTION: User IDs are always UUIDs
 * Reason: Based on existing user model pattern
 * Impact: Will fail if non-UUID IDs are used
 * TODO: Confirm with team
 */
```
